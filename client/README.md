# Project Title

## Overview

This project is a web application designed to aid users in generating Entity relationship diagrams. The application leverages modern web technologies to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Technology Choices

### Frontend

- **React**: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components, making the codebase more maintainable.
- **Vite**: Vite is used as the build tool and development server. It provides fast hot module replacement (HMR) and a streamlined development experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, Tailwind CSS is utilized. This utility-first CSS framework allows for rapid UI development with a focus on responsiveness and customization.

- **Axios**: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API. It simplifies the process of handling requests and responses, including error handling.

### State Management

- **Context API**: The React Context API is used for state management across the application. This allows for a centralized way to manage user authentication state and project data without prop drilling.

### Backend

- **Node.js / Express**: The backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API for user authentication and project management.

- **Database**: [Specify the database used, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.], which stores user data and project information.

## Design Decisions

- **Component Structure**: The application is structured into reusable components, such as `Header`, `ChatContent`, and `ChatInput`, to promote modularity and separation of concerns.

- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. Tailwind CSS is used to achieve this responsiveness efficiently.

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the application, particularly in API calls, to provide users with meaningful feedback.

- **User Experience**: The application focuses on providing a smooth user experience with features like loading indicators, form validations, and clear navigation.
